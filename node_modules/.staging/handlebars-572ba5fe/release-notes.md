# Release Notes

## Development

[Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.0.14...master)

## v4.0.14 - April 13th, 2019
Chore/Test:
- test: remove safari from saucelabs - 871accc

Bugfixes: 
- fix: prevent RCE through the "lookup"-helper - cd38583

Compatibility notes:

Access to the constructor of a class thought `{{lookup obj "constructor" }}` is now prohibited. This closes 
a leak that only half closed in versions 4.0.13 and 4.1.0, but it is a slight incompatibility.

This kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described
in #1495. We will **not** increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented, 
and because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version
and the issue may not be resolved on many systems). 


[Commits](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/compare/v4.0.13...v4.0.14)

## v4.0.13 - February 7th, 2019
New Features

- none

Security fixes:

- disallow access to the constructor in templates to prevent RCE - 42841c4, #1495

Housekeeping

- chore: fix components/handlebars package.json and auto-update on release - bacd473
- chore: Use node 10 to build handlebars - 78dd89c

Compatibility notes:

Access to class constructors (i.e. `({}).constructor`) is now prohibited to prevent
Remote Code Execution. This means that following construct will no work anymore:

```
class SomeClass {
}

SomeClass.staticProperty = 'static'

var template = Handlebars.compile('{{constructor.staticProperty}}');
document.getElementById('output').innerHTML = template(new SomeClass());
// expected: 'static', but now this is empty.
```

This kind of access is not the intended use of Handlebars and leads to the vulnerability described in #1495. We will **not** increase the major version, because such use is not intended or documented, and because of the potential impact of the issue (we fear that most people won't use a new major version and the issue may not be resolved on many systems).

- Fix location information for programs - [93faffa](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/commit/93faffa)

Compatibility notes:
- Depthed paths are now conditionally pushed on to the stack. If the helper uses the same context, then a new stack is not created. This leads to behavior that better matches expectations for helpers like `if` that do not seem to alter the context. Any instances of `../` in templates will need to be checked for the correct behavior under 4.0.0. In general templates will either reduce the number of `../` instances or leave them as is. See [#1028](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/issues/1028).
- The `=` character is now HTML escaped. This closes a potential exploit case when using unquoted attributes, i.e. `<div foo={{bar}}>`. In general it's recommended that attributes always be quoted when their values are generated from a mustache to avoid any potential exploit surfaces.
- AST constructors have been dropped in favor of plain old javascript objects
- The runtime version has been increased. Precompiled templates will need to use runtime of at least 4.0.0.

Compatibility notes:

- `SafeString` is now duck typed on `toHTML`

New Features:
- noConflict
- Source Maps
- Block Params
- Strict Mode
- @last and other each changes
- Chained else blocks

- Expose escapeExpression on the root object - 980c38c
- Remove nested function eval in blockHelperMissing - 6f22ec1
- Fix compiler program de-duping - 9e3f824

Compatibility notes:
- The default build now outputs a generic UMD wrapper. This should be transparent change but may cause issues in some environments.
- Runtime compatibility breaks in both directions. Ensure that both compiler and client are upgraded to 2.0.0-beta.1 or higher at the same time.
  - `programWithDepth` has been removed an instead an array of context values is passed to fields needing depth lookups.
- `false` values are now printed to output rather than silently dropped
- Lines containing only block statements and whitespace are now removed. This matches the Mustache spec but may cause issues with code that expects whitespace to exist but would not otherwise.
- Partials that are standalone will now indent their rendered content
- `AST.ProgramNode`'s signature has changed. 
- Numerious methods/features removed from psuedo-API classes
  - `JavaScriptCompiler.register`
  - `JavaScriptCompiler.replaceStack` no longer supports non-inline replace
  - `Compiler.disassemble`
  - `DECLARE` opcode
  - `strip` opcode
  - `lookup` opcode
  - Content nodes may have their `string` values mutated over time. `original` field provides the unmodified value.
- Removed unused `Handlebars.registerHelper` `inverse` parameter
- `each` helper requires iterator parameter
